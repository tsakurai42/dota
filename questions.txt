questions to ask:

	weight columns like patch so more recent (higher number) holds more value
		doesnt' work on logistical regression?

pick columns shouldn't care if a hero is picked 1st or 5th
	or should it? maybe picking hero #10 1st is wose than picking that same hero 5th?

i didn't change hero ids, is the model treating them as label encoded or does it think it's a continuous range of numbers?

	same for team_id's, is it taking those as categories (each number is unique to a team), or does it 	think that 1838315 might be stronger than 39 just becuase it's a much higher number?

what format does the input for "model.predict" need to be

difference between score and f1 score
